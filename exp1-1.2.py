1.2) Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers (use three
separate input statements). Create variables called total and average that hold
the sum and average of the three numbers and print out the values of total and
average.

Program:
a=int(input("Enter a value:"))
b=int(input("Enter b value:"))
c=int(input("Enter c value:"))
t=(a+b+c)
avg=t/3
print("Total of the 3 numbers is:",t)
print("Average of the 3 numbers is:",avg)

Output:
Enter a value:4
Enter b value:5
Enter c value:6
Total of the 3 numbers is: 15
Average of the 3 numbers is: 5.0
